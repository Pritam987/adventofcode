    "--- Day 8: Haunted Wasteland ---\n",
    "You're still riding a camel across Desert Island when you spot a sandstorm quickly approaching. When you turn to warn the Elf, she disappears before your eyes! To be fair, she had just finished warning you about ghosts a few minutes ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the camel's pouches is labeled \"maps\" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of network of labeled nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like you're meant to use the left/right instructions to navigate the network. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can escape the haunted wasteland!\n",
    "\n",
    "After examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: AAA and ZZZ. You feel like AAA is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right instructions until you reach ZZZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "This format defines each node of the network individually. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "RL\n",
    "\n",
    "AAA = (BBB, CCC)\n",
    "BBB = (DDD, EEE)\n",
    "CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)\n",
    "DDD = (DDD, DDD)\n",
    "EEE = (EEE, EEE)\n",
    "GGG = (GGG, GGG)\n",
    "ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\n",
    "Starting with AAA, you need to look up the next element based on the next left/right instruction in your input. In this example, start with AAA and go right (R) by choosing the right element of AAA, CCC. Then, L means to choose the left element of CCC, ZZZ. By following the left/right instructions, you reach ZZZ in 2 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you might not find ZZZ right away. If you run out of left/right instructions, repeat the whole sequence of instructions as necessary: RL really means RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL... and so on. For example, here is a situation that takes 6 steps to reach ZZZ:\n",
    "\n",
    "LLR\n",
    "\n",
    "AAA = (BBB, BBB)\n",
    "BBB = (AAA, ZZZ)\n",
    "ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\n",
    "Starting at AAA, follow the left/right instructions. How many steps are required to reach ZZZ?"
